# Azure Container Apps landing zone accelerator

Azure landing zone accelerators provide architectural guidance, reference architectures, reference implementations, and automation to deploy workload platforms on Azure at scale. They are aligned with industry proven practices, such as those presented in [Azure landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) guidance in the Cloud Adoption Framework.

This Azure Container Apps landing zone accelerator represents the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Container Apps deployment, owned and operated by an workload team.

This repository provides packaged guidance for customer scenarios, reference architecture, reference implementation, tooling, design area guidance, sample application deployed after provisioning the infrastructure using the accelerator. The architectural approach can be used as design guidance for greenfield implementation and as an assessment for brownfield customers already using containerized apps.

## :mag: Design areas

The architecture is considered across four key design areas. Please review them as part of your overall understanding of this landing zone accelerator.

- [Identity and Access Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/container-apps/identity)
- [Network Topology and Connectivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/container-apps/networking)
- [Security, Governance, and Compliance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/container-apps/security)
- [Management and Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/container-apps/management)

## :rocket: Reference implementation

This repo contains the Azure landing zone accelerator's reference implementations, all with supporting *Infrastructure as Code* artifacts. The scenarios covered are:

:arrow_forward: [Scenario 1: Azure Container Apps - Internal environment secure baseline](scenarios/aca-internal/README.md)

*More reference implementation scenarios will be added as they become available.*
